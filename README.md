When you first open the project you will be met with the main.cpp file 
In this file u only need to run the project. After running you will be met with the first requirement of the project: You need to choose how many cities you want your salesman to go to 
In the second requirement you will need to choose how you want your input to be given: Press 1 to input a matrix of your choosing(note that the element at position i and j needs to be equal to the element at position j and i) or Press 2 to generate a matrix randomly with numbers between 1 and 100
After that you will be met with a bunch of information regarding the 3 methods used : BFS, UCS and A*
For each of the methods you will have the best path to choose, the minimum cost to visit all cities and the time that was required to run each method
